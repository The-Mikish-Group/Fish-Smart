## Estimated Monthly Cost

**For your Fish-Smart application:**
- **RAM Usage**: ~1GB = $10/month
- **CPU Usage**: ~0.5 vCPU = $10/month  
- **Storage**: ~1GB = $0.15/month
- **Total Estimated**: ~$20.15/month

**Cost Savings**: $100/month â†’ $20/month = **$80/month savings!**

## Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Domain Setup**: Point Fish-Smart.com to your Railway URL
2. **Database**: Your existing SQL Server will work seamlessly
3. **File Storage**: Consider adding Railway Volumes for persistent files
4. **Monitoring**: Railway provides built-in monitoring and logs

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback:
1. Your original hosting remains unchanged
2. Simply update your domain DNS back to original hosting
3. No data loss - your database stays the same

## Next Steps

1. Install Docker Desktop locally (for testing)
2. Test the container build locally
3. Push to GitHub
4. Deploy to Railway
5. Update DNS to point to Railway

Would you like me to help you install Docker Desktop to test locally first?
